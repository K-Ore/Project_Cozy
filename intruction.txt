Lazy Loading Implementation
1. All pages in /pages folder are lazy-loaded
2. Components organized for code splitting
3. Barrel exports (index.js) for clean imports

Performance Optimizations
1. Component-level CSS modules
2. Custom hooks for state management
3. Context providers for global state
4. Service layer for API caching
5. Utility functions for reusable logic

Modular Architecture
1. Feature-based component organization
2. Separated concerns (UI, Layout, Features)
3. Custom hooks for business logic
4. Service layer for API interactions

Development Best Practices
1. Consistent file naming conventions
2. Module CSS for scoped styling
3. Barrel exports for clean imports
4. Separation of concerns
5. Reusable component library
